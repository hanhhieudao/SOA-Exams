% the following key values give the set up for hiding certain

% equally well with "foo".  Each one of these redefines the outer
% environment for an atom to turn the whole thing into a hidden
% comment.  Note that the environments theorem, example, etc. do not
% have to be written in any special way for hide and show to work.
% They get clobbered by hide.

% and proofs.
\newcommand{\HideEnvirons}[1]{\setkeys{hide}{#1}}


% The \ShowEnvirons command works like this: if it's argument is foo,
% it redefines the *hide* family key for foo to do nothing.  Then, it
% issues a \HideEnvirons command containing a list of all the atom
% types.  So, everything is hidden *unless* the hide-family key has
% been redefinied.
